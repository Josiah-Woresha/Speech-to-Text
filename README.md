# Speech-to-Text
Hey guys.
Recently, I came to understand that software development is all about solving problems using technology(code).
What I decided to do today is, instead of my typing my documentation like the way am doing now, why couldn't I create a specch to text converter program that does 90% of the work for me. 
The only thing i will do is just "TALK" and the program will convert the speech to text and at i would just copy and paste the code where i want.
